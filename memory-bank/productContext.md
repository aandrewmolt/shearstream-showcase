## Project Goal

Build a modern, React-based showcase application that demonstrates complete modernization of the ShearStream oil & gas frac monitoring platform. The goal is to create a dashboard that is 110%+ better than the original Vue.js application, featuring:
- Modern React 19 + TypeScript architecture
- Real-time data visualization with 2-second polling
- Beautiful glassmorphism design with perfect 8-point grid alignment
- PWA capabilities for offline access
- Enhanced features like predictive alerts, AI insights, and collaboration tools

## Key Features

### Current Implementation (Completed):
- âœ… Landing page with hero section and feature showcase
- âœ… Dashboard with live job monitoring (Job #746 - Ballard-Joanne-Fed)
- âœ… **SciChart.js Unified Chart:** Professional WebGL-accelerated visualization with all channels in single overlay
- âœ… **Vercel API Proxy:** Serverless CORS-free data access with secure credential management
- âœ… Interactive chart controls: pan, zoom, hover inspection, zoom-to-fit
- âœ… Multi-axis support: Pressure (left), Rate (left), Concentration (right)
- âœ… Real-time value display boxes with trend indicators
- âœ… KPI cards: Active Channels, Data Points, Refresh Rate
- âœ… Treatment Summary: Volume, Proppant, Avg Pressure, Current Stage
- âœ… Real-time data updates every 2 seconds with 60 FPS rendering
- âœ… Time range selector (5m, 15m, 1h, 4h, All)
- âœ… Channel visibility toggles (8 channels)
- âœ… Perfect alignment with 8-point grid system
- âœ… Modern dark theme with petroleum orange branding

### API Integration (Completed):
- âœ… Phase 1: Core Data endpoints (15+ endpoints tested)
- âœ… Phase 2: Time Series Data endpoints (real-time polling)
- âœ… Comprehensive API documentation (API_RESPONSES.md)
- âœ… Safe GET-only testing on production system
- âœ… **Real-Time API Integration Infrastructure:** Complete API service layer with OAuth authentication, 2-second polling, error handling, and React Query hooks for seamless data fetching

### Missing Features (From Original):
- ðŸ”´ Projects Overview Page (main dashboard with all projects)
- ðŸ”´ Company Dashboard Page (company-specific view)
- ðŸ”´ Charts Menu Page (chart management)
- ðŸ”´ Real-time value displays below charts (large colored boxes)
- ðŸ”´ Chart toolbar (zoom, draw, settings)
- ðŸ”´ Full breadcrumb hierarchy (Company â†’ Pad â†’ Project â†’ Chart)

### Killer Features (Planned - See KILLER_FEATURES.md):
- AI-powered predictive alerts
- Historical job comparison
- Time travel replay
- Multi-job dashboard
- Voice commands & AI assistant
- Real-time collaboration
- Custom dashboard builder

## Overall Architecture

### Tech Stack:
- **Frontend:** React 19 + TypeScript
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4
- **Charts:** SciChart.js Community Edition (WebGL/WebAssembly accelerated)
- **Animation:** Framer Motion
- **Data Fetching:** TanStack Query
- **API Proxy:** Vercel Serverless Functions
- **PWA:** vite-plugin-pwa + Workbox
- **Icons:** Lucide React

### Architecture Patterns:
- Component-based architecture
- Custom hooks for data fetching
- Context for global state (if needed)
- Service layer for API calls
- Type-safe API interfaces

### API Architecture:
- **Base URL:** https://production.api.shearstreaming.com
- **Authentication:** OAuth 2.0 via Keycloak
- **Polling:** 2-second intervals for real-time data
- **Endpoints:** REST API with GET-only operations (safe for production)

### Data Flow:
1. useJobData hook fetches timeseries metadata
2. useTimeseriesData hook polls data every 2 seconds
3. Charts receive data and render with Recharts
4. State updates trigger smooth Framer Motion animations

- **Grid:** 8-point system (8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px)
- **Colors:** Petroleum orange (#FB923C), Dark theme, Glass morphism
- **Typography:** System fonts, clear hierarchy
- **Spacing:** Consistent padding/margins using 8pt grid
- **Alignment:** Perfect centering with flexbox patterns
